-- YET ANOTHER CASE WHEN PROBLEM :D

-- Return the titles and descriptions of all films, with a new column "Holiday",
-- that contains the holiday referenced in the film, if any, otherwise is blank.
-- all holiday's welcome :) 

-- EXAMPLE: 
-- title: "Fiction Christmas" -> 'Christmas'
-- description: "The story of a chritmas elf who ...." --> 'Christmas'
-- "Something About Mary" --> ""

-- BONUS: return all of the holiday films first, and sort all films with their 
-- respective holiday category in alphabetical order.

-- BONUS BONUS:
-- Our marketing team is doing a holiday promo. All holiday films 1/2.
-- Can you return the same results, but with the price reflecting the discount?





-- HINTS:

--** get the title and descriptiom of all films.

--** Set up the logic to check if a film is a holiday film.
  
--** create the CASE WHEN logic
-- CASE
-- WHEN (condition) THEN <output>
-- WHEN (condition) THEN <output>
-- ELSE <output>
-- END as <alias>

-- EXAMPLE:
--  SELECT 
-- 	name,
--   	CASE 
--      WHEN (monthlymaintenance > 100) THEN 'expensive'
--  	ELSE 'cheap'
--  	END AS cost <<-- this whole thing outputs a column ('cost') with output ('expensive','cheap')
-- 						depending on the condition being met in each row
--  FROM ...



--** Do the previous query, but return all of the holiday films first, and sort all films with their 
-- respective holiday category in alphabetical order.


--** Apply the promo by wrapping the previous query in a CTE, then doing another CASE WHEN statement
